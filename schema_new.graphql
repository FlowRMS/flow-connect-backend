/home/jorge/flowrms/FLO-727_fix/flow-py-backend/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/polars/_cpu_check.py:250: RuntimeWarning: Missing required CPU features.

The following required CPU features were not detected:
    avx2, fma, bmi1, bmi2, lzcnt, movbe
Continuing to use this version of Polars on this processor will likely result in a crash.
Install `polars[rtcompat]` instead of `polars` to run Polars with better compatibility.

Hint: If you are on an Apple ARM machine (e.g. M1) this is likely due to running Python under Rosetta.
It is recommended to install a native version of Python that does not run under Rosetta x86-64 emulation.

If you believe this warning to be a false positive, you can set the `POLARS_SKIP_CPU_CHECK` environment variable to bypass this check.
